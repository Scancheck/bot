## Command List
---
Command | Syntax | Usage

`.test`|`.test`|Test if bot can see and reply to commands. Replies with "ðŸ¤–" (`:robot:`).
`.addquote`|`.addquote <@user>\|<quote>`|Adds a 'quote' to the server's quote.txt in `\quotes\`

`@someone`|any message containing `@someone`|Picks a random user from the server and mentions them. Meant to emulate discord's 2018 april fools joke. 
Dadbot|`I'm <message>`|Replies to user with the side splittingly hilarious 'Hi, \<so and so>, I'm Dad'. No, I will not remove this feature. 
`.widespace`|`.widespace <text>`|Inserts a space every second character of supplied text, for that `a e s t h e t i c` feeling.
`.verbose`|`.verbose <text>`|Attempts to sound smart by replacing every word with a longer related word. Results may vary.
`.succinct`|`.succinct <text>`|The opposite of `.verbose`, picking the shortest related word. Less funny than `.verbose`.
`.smush`|`.smush <word1> <word2>`|Attempts to make a portmanteau of the two supplied words. Works best with long words.
`.choose`|`.choose <item1>\|<item2>\|<item3>\|...`|Randomly picks one item out of a supplied array. 
`.rate`|`.rate <text>`|Randomly rates the supplied text out of 10.
`.flip`|`.flip`|Flip a coin, returns heads or tails.
`bot`|any message containing `bot`|Uses sentiment analysis to respond to comments about bot. Yes, it is overkill. 
`pee stream`|`pee stream`|Garbage local meme
`oopsie`|`oopsie`|uWu
`.emotes`|`.emotes <number>`|Picks some random emotes (WIP)
